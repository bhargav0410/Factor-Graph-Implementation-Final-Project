# Distributed-Computing-LDPC-codes-MPI

THe repository consists of Factor Graph based implementation of deocding of LDPC and LT codes. Currently, the code within the repository can be used for construction, encoding, and decoding of QAM based input symbols. The encoding and deocding can be done using LDPC or LT codes. The encoding and decoding can also be performed by using Parity Check and Generator matices constructed using other softwares and programs.

This project is a part of COSMOS and a tutorial will be posted shortly on how to use the code for wireless experimentation with COSMOS and ORBIT Testbeds. Steps to run the files for MPI and CUDA based LDPC encoding and decoding have been added.
